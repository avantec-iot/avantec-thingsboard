Why Avantec

In early years, products manufactured and exported by Avantec were highly diversified, ranging from gaming, electronics dictionary, handheld timers, to corded and cordless telephones.

Over the past decade, we have evolved into product design and serve customers around the world with our branded products. Three major product lines are (1) Telecommunication, (2) Education and (3) HVAC (Heating, Ventilating, Air Conditioning and refrigeration).
