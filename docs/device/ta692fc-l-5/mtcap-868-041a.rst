.. _First-Time Setup of Gateway:

First-Time Setup of Gateway
----------------------------

.. Note::

    This configuration works with the LoRa packet forwarder. You may choose to use Ethernet with LoRa or Cellular with LoRa (if your model has a cellular radio).

This setup wizard helps you configure the main features of your device for initial setup. In most cases, you can accept the provided defaults. See **First-Time Setup** in the `software guide <https://www.multitech.com/documents/publications/software-guides/s000727--mPower-Edge-Intelligence-Conduit-AEP-software-guide.pdf>`_ for more details.

#. Go to your browser’s address line and enter the default IP address for the gateway to access the UI: 192.168.2.1. Most browsers display a warning about HTTP addresses being unsafe. Click on **Advanced** and continue to 192.168.2.1.

#. Configure your device's **Cellular** connection.
    a. If you have no cellular radio (Ethernet only) in your device or plan to use Ethernet with the LoRa packet forwarder, accept all defaults with **Enabled** deactivated (Cellular is disabled) and APN left blank.
    b. If you have a cellular radio model and plan to use **Cellular** with the LoRa packet forwarder, select **Enabled** (Cellular is enabled).
    c. If required by your network carrier, enter your **APN** (Some carrier networks may set it automatically via OTA registration. Leave it blank in that case).

.. _Configuring LoRa Packet Forwarder:

Configuring LoRa Packet Forwarder
---------------------------------

Using Ethernet with LoRa Packet Forwarder
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you are planning to use Ethernet with the LoRa Packet Forwarder, then you must make
this configuration change below before configuring and running Packet Forwarder. If you
are using a Cellular connection with LoRa, you can skip these steps.

#. Go to **Network Interfaces**. Click the pencil for the **eth0** interface.

    .. image:: /_static/device/ta692fc-l-5/mtcap-868-041a/using-ethernet-with-lora-packet-forwarder-1.png

#. Under **Network Interface ETH0**, 
    a. change **Direction** to **WAN**.
    b. Under **Mode**, select **DHCP Client**.
    c. Click **Submit**.

    .. image:: /_static/device/ta692fc-l-5/mtcap-868-041a/using-ethernet-with-lora-packet-forwarder-2.png

#. Go to **Administration** > **Access Configuration** > **HTTPS**, Enable HTTPS via WAN, then click **Submit**.

    .. image:: /_static/device/ta692fc-l-5/mtcap-868-041a/using-ethernet-with-lora-packet-forwarder-3.png

#. Click Save and Apply.


Configuring the Gateway
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To activate **LoRa Packet Forwarder** Mode on your device:

#. For **LoRaWAN** > **Network Settings** > **LoRa Mode**, select **PACKET FORWARDER** under **Mode**. If **Manual Configuration** is showing, click **Normal Configuration** to switch.

    .. image:: /_static/device/ta692fc-l-5/mtcap-868-041a/configuring-the-gateway-1.png

#. For **LoRaWAN** > **Network Settings** > **LoRa Packet Forwarder Configuration**, 
    a. You should select the network to use from the drop-down under **Network**: **Manual**, **Radio Bridge ChirpStack**, **The Things Network**, **Senet**, or **Loriot**. In this case, select **Manual**.
    b. Select the appropriate **Channel Plan** for the Packet Forwarder. Choose from the drop-down menu: **US915: 915**, **AU915: 915**, **AS923-1: 915**, **AS923-2: 915**, **AS923-3: 915**, **AS923-4: 915**, **KR920: 915**, **EU868: 868**, **IN865: 868**, **RU864: 868**, or **ISM2400: 2400**. In this case, select **EU868**.
    c. Type your LoRaWAN Network **Server address** - your ChirpStack IP.
    d. Type **upstream port** & **downstream port**: 1700.
    e. Click **Submit**.

#. Make sure to properly add your gateway and any end devices to the network based on their specific system and instructions. For this example, we will configure the gateway and end device using **Manual**.



.. _MTCAP Firmware Upgrade:

Optional: Firmware Upgrade
---------------------------

.. tip::

  To install mPower 6.3.0, the Conduit gateway must be upgraded to mPower 6.0.0 or higher. Customers that are running earlier versions of mPower should use the following upgrade process.
